> Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women and rarely in men. It refers to a condition in which cells grow out of control in the breast and begin to grow uncontrollably. Although breast cancer is treatable when detected early, it is often found in advanced stages at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is important when diagnosing breast cancer.

# Purpose of the Study

> The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer types (benign and malignant). Based on patients' clinical data, this model can determine whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. Such a model is critical for early diagnosis of the disease and proper treatment planning.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing

> The data used in the study were obtained from " https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset " patients diagnosed with breast cancer. In the preprocessing stage, the data were standardized, feature was reduced according to iportance values and missing values were filled in to avoid multi-corr for use in machine learning. In addition, categorical variables were converted into numerical values.

# Machine Learning Model

> The developed model uses Random Forest algorithm to predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant using a set of features. The model is trained on the training dataset and then tested on the validation dataset. Performance metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model.

# Results and Significance

> The developed machine learning model showed high accuracy and reliability in identifying breast cancer types. This helps patients make the right decisions in their diagnosis and treatment. Early detection of cancer cases can improve their chances of cure and increase survival rates. Therefore, the results of this study could provide a significant advance in breast cancer diagnosis and management.
